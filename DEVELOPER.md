# Building and Testing RDS-JSThis document describes how to set up your development environment to build and test RDS-Python.It also explains the basic mechanics of using `git`.* [Prerequisite Software](#prerequisite-software)* [Getting the Sources](#getting-the-sources)* [Installing NPM Modules](#installing-npm-modules)* [Building](#building)* [Running Tests Locally](#running-tests-locally)* [Formatting your Source Code](#formatting-your-source-code)* [Linting/verifying your Source Code](#lintingverifying-your-source-code)See the [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)if you'd like to contribute to RDS-Python.## Prerequisite SoftwareBefore you can build and test RDS-Python, you must install and configure thefollowing products on your development machine:* [Git](http://git-scm.com) and/or the **GitHub app** (for [Mac](http://mac.github.com) or  [Windows](http://windows.github.com)); [GitHub's Guide to Installing  Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) is a good source of information.* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), provides quick access to the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) IDE for writing python as well as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) for data visualization and analysis.## Getting the SourcesFork and clone the RDS-Python repository:1. Login to your GitHub account or create one by following the instructions given   [here](https://github.com/signup/free).2. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking) the [RDS-Python   repository](https://github.com/mtna/rds-python).3. Clone your fork of the RDS-Python repository and define an `upstream` remote pointing back to   the RDS-Python repository that you forked in the first place.```shell# Clone your GitHub repository:git clone git@github.com:<github username>/rds-python.git# Go to the RDS-Python directory:cd rds-python# Add the main RDS-Python repository as an upstream remote to your repository:git remote add upstream https://github.com/mtna/rds-python.git```## Installing Python ModulesNext, install the Python modules needed to test RDS-Python:```shell# Install RDS-Python project dependencies (package.json)pip install pytestpip install blackpip install pyflakes```## BuildingTo build RDS-Python run:```shellpython setup.py build```* Results are put in the `dist/` folder.## Running Tests LocallyPytest is used as the primary tool for testing RDS-Python.You should execute all test suites before submitting a PR to GitHub:- `pytest`All the tests are executed on our Continuous Integration infrastructure. PRs can only bemerged if the code is formatted properly and all tests are passing.<a name="clang-format"></a>## Formatting your source codeRDS-Python uses [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to format the source code.If the source code is not properly formatted, the CI will fail and the PR cannot be merged.You can automatically format your code by running:- `black {source_file_or_directory}`## Linting/verifying your Source CodeYou can check that your code is properly formatted and adheres to coding style by running:- `pyflakes {source_file_or_directory}`
